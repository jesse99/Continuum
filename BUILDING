* Build the gear project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/gear-sharp/>.
Use the version in svn and execute 'make lib' followed by 'sudo make install'.

* Build the mobjc project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mobjc/>.
Use the version in svn and execute 'make libs' followed by 'sudo make install'.

* Build the mcocoa project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mcocoa/>.
Use the version in svn and execute 'make update-libraries', 'make generate', 'make lib', 
and 'sudo make install'.
 
* Navigate to the Continuum directory and execute 'make update-libraries'.

* Copy Mono.Cecil.dll and Mono.Cecil.Mdb into Continuum's bin directory (create 
the bin directory if it does not exist). For Mono.Cecil.Mdb you should be able to
use the one in the gac which is normally at a path like:
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/mono/gac. For
Mono.Cecil.dll you can use the one on the gac if you have Mono 2.6, but for earlier mono's you'll want to grab the one from the Continuum binary distribution or build it from source.

 * Execute 'make run-app'. This will build the Continuum app and run it from the Terminal.
Console output will appear in the Terminal instead of the Console app.

If you plan on working on Continuum you may want to execute './make-foreshadow'. This will
copy the Continuum app and make a new app named Foreshadow. Then you can make changes
to Continuum without disturbing your tool chain. Once you're happy with your changes you 
can build a new Foreshadow.
