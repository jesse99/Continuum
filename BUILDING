* Build the gear project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/gear-sharp/>.
 Use the version in svn and execute 'make lib' followed by 'sudo make install'.

* Build the mobjc project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mobjc/>.
 Use the version in svn and execute 'make libs' followed by 'sudo make install'.

* Build the mcocoa project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mcocoa/>.
 Use the version in svn and execute 'make update-libraries', 'make lib', and 'sudo make install'.

* Build the latest version of Cecil (you may not need to use the svn version with Mono 2.4). To 
do this download the source using 'svn co svn://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/mcs/class/Mono.Cecil'
and build it using 'make -f standalone.make'.

* Navigate to the Continuum directory and execute 'make update-libraries'.

* Copy the Mono.Cecil.dll you built to Continuum's bin directory.

 * Copy Mono.Cecil.Mdb.dll to Continuum's build directory. You can find this with the locate 
 command. It will normally be in a directory like 
 '/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/2.0/lib/mono/2.0/'.
 
 * Execute 'make run-app'. This will build the Continuum app and run it from the Terminal.
 Console output will appear in the Terminal instead of the Console app.

If you plan on working on Continuum you may want to execute './make-foreshadow'. This will
copy the Continuum app and make a new app named Foreshadow. Then you can make changes
to Continuum without disturbing your tool chain. Once you're happy with your changes you 
can build a new Foreshadow.
