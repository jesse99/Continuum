Continuum relies on a number of other projects. So, in order to build Continuum you'll
need assemblies for all of them. If you're building the released version of the Continuum
source you can simply copy the Mono.Cecil.Mdb, Mono.Cecil, gear, mcocoa, and mobjc dlls
from the Continuum bundle into the bin directory. But if you are building from git you
should:

* Build the gear project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/gear-sharp/>.
Use the version in svn and execute `make lib` followed by `sudo make install`.

* Build the mobjc project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mobjc/>.
Use the version in svn and execute `make libs` followed by `sudo make install`.

* Build the mcocoa project. You can find this at <http://code.google.com/p/mcocoa/>.
Use the version in svn and execute `make update-libraries`, `make generate`, `make lib`, 
and `sudo make install`.
 
* Navigate to the Continuum directory and execute `make update-libraries`. (This is the
safe way to build, but you can also try simply copying the assemblies from the distributed
application bundle into the bin directory).

* Copy Mono.Cecil.dll and Mono.Cecil.Mdb into Continuum's bin directory (create 
the bin directory if it does not exist). For Mono.Cecil.Mdb you should be able to
use the one in the gac which is normally at a path like:
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/mono/gac. For Mono.Cecil.dll you 
can use the one on the gac if you have Mono 2.6, but for earlier mono's you'll want to grab 
the one from the Continuum binary distribution or build it from source.

* Copy Mono.Debugger.Soft.dll and Mono.Debugger.Soft.dll.mdb into Continuum's bin directory.
You can copy these out of the gac, but you may need to use mono 2.10 or later.

Once you have those assemblies in the bin directory you can build Continuum itself. To do
that type either `make app` or `make run-app`.

If you plan on working on Continuum you may want to execute `./make-foreshadow`. This will
copy the Continuum app and make a new app named Foreshadow. Then you can use Foreshadow
as a stable version of the app while you work on Continuum.
