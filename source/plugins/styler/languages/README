The language files are used to do syntax hilighting for text files and to control
what qualifies as a word for operations like double-clicking. Language globs
are patterns used to associate a file with a language. Typically they are the 
exact name of a file ('Makefile') or based on the file's extension ('*.cs').

New languages can be added to the user directory. The languages are
defined in terms of .NET regular expressions, see the Language.schema
file for more details. When adding a new language the globs file should
be updated to add a glob for that language.

The standard languages may be modified, but it's best to do this by copying
the language file into the user directory and modifying it there. If you don't
do this then your changes will be lost when upgrading to a new version of
Continuum.

Note that changes to language files are not dynamic: you need to restart
Continuum for them to take effect. Changes the language globs are also
not dynamic unless you do them via the preferences panel.
