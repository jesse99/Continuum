Scripts are language agnostic command line tools used to modify the 
selection in a Continuum text window. The scripts may be written in 
any language but need to use a shebang (like #!/bin/sh) so that they 
can be run by simply executing them. 

The script should read from standard in and write to standard out.

Scripts in the standard and user directories are added to the Text menu.
Scripts in the standard directory will be overwritten if they are out of date.
Continuum scripts that are missing from both the standard and unused
directories will be copied into the standard directory.
