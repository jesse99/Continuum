Refactors are language specific scripts or plugins which operate on entire
source code files. The scripts may be written in any language but need to 
use a shebang (like #!/bin/sh) so that they can be run by simply executing 
them.

The script will be passed the location of the selection as its first argument
and the length of the selection as the second argument. The script should
read the file from stdin and write the modifed file to stdout.

Scripts in the standard and user directories are added to the Refactor menu.
Scripts in the standard directory will be overwritten if they are out of date.
Continuum scripts that are missing from both the standard and unused
directories will be copied into the standard directory.
