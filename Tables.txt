Currently only the object-model plugin uses the database. Times are in System.DateTime
ticks. Field names appended with # are part of the primary key. Field names appended
with $ are foreign keys. Note that the main database should only be used for data which
can be re-generated.

Note that there is some tension here between exposing attributes to allow for custom queries
and the database size/query times. Even with this relatively simple schema the size of the
database can be 100+ megabytes.

-------------------
Assemblies
hash#		name		culture	major	minor	build	revision	

* hash is an md5sum of the assembly. (We can't rely on the public key because not all assemblies
  have strong names and because different versions of mono assemblies use the same public
  key and version).
* name is the name of the assembly, e.g. "mobjc".
* culture is the lower-case culture targeted by the assembly, e.g. "neutral" or "en-us".
* major, minor, build, and revision are integers and compose the assemblies
  version number.
  
Note that because the primary key is the assemblies hash assemblies can be regarded
as immutable: if an assembly is recompiled it winds up with an entirely new set of types
and methods.

-------------------
AssemblyPaths
path#		hash$		write_time

* path is the full path to the assembly.
* hash is from the Assemblies table.
* write_time is the local time the assembly was generated on.

-------------------
NameInfo
full_name#	hash#$		file_name		name#	kind

* full_name is the full name of a type or method.
* hash is from the Assemblies table.
* file_name is the name (not path) the type is declared within. May be empty.
* name is the name of a type or method. Generic types will have both Foo`1 and Foo.
* kind is 0 for a method, 1 for an interface, 2 for a class, and 3 for a sealed type.

-------------------
Types
type#$			hash#$			name		declaring_type		namespace		base_type			attributes						

* type is the full name of the type, e.g. "MObjc.WeakList`1".
* hash is from the Assemblies table.
* name is the name of the type, not including the generic argument count, e.g. "WeakList".
* declaring_type is the full name of the type the type is nested within. May be empty. 
* namespace is the namespace the type was declared in. May be empty if the type is inside the global namespace.
* base_type is the full name of the type the type inherits from. May be empty. Might not be in Types.
* attributes is the same as Cecil's TypeAttributes.

-------------------
Implements
type#$		hash#$		interface_type#

* type is from the Types table and is a full name of a type.
* hash is from the Assemblies table.
* interface_type is a full name of an interface the type implements. Might not be in Types.

-------------------
Methods
method#	hash#$		return_type	name	arg_types			arg_names	declaring_type$		file		line		attributes		semantics						

* method is the full name of the method, e.g. "System.Boolean MObjc.Registrar::TryGetType(System.String,System.Type&)".
* hash is from the Assemblies table.
* return_type is something like "System.Boolean".
* name is the name of the method, e.g. "TryGetType". Note that the name will have a prefix for
  event, indexer, operator, and property methods. E.g. "set_Text" or "op_Add".
* arg_types contains a colon separated list of the agument types, e.g. "System.String:System.Type&".
* arg_names contains a colon separated list of the agument names, e.g. "name:type".
* declaring_type is from Types and is the full name of the declaring type.
* return_type is the full name of the return type. It will usually be in TypeNames.
* file is the full path of the method's compilation unit. May be empty.
* line is the 1-based line number within the compilation unit. May be -1.
* attributes is the same as Cecil's MethodAttributes.
* semantics is the same as Cecil's MethodSemanticsAttributes.

TODO: need to store custom attributes		


_id can be used but should be unique schema wide (and don't use the table name as the prefix)
attribute names should not contain the table name (makes joins really clunky)
names should not change from place to place, eg MetadataTokens should just be tokens, 
   not method_token and type_token
don't split attributes across tables (eg MaleStudents and FemaleStudents tables)
don't split attributes across columns (eg one col tells you how to interpret another)
