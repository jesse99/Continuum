Version 0.5 (r226)

* Added support for building via nant.
* Added support for disassembling assemblies. You can dissasemble entire assemblies by
   opening them using the Open command or disassemble a type/methid using the context 
   menu. Note that the disassembly is much nicer than monodis. Among other things it is color 
   coded, nests exception handlers, and includes the source file in comments (if the assembly 
   has an mdb file).
* Added Open as Binary command.
* Added support for viewing files in Time Machine. This is done by choosing Find in Time
   Machine using the context menu which will open the latest version of the file from Time
   Machine. Older versions can also be opened using the context menu on the files from
   within Time Machine.
* Added a Save To command.
* Added a text document info window which allows line ending, format, encoding, and language
   to be viewed and changed.
* Text files can now be optionally word wrapped.
* Added support for decoding utf-32.
* Added a Reverse Lines script.
* Added a Look Up in Dictionary command (which will use Wikipedia as well as the built-in
   dictionary).
* Added support for styling the m4 and css languages.
* Added svn cat to the context menu.
* Improved the directory window:
   - It's now a lot more efficient for very large directory trees.
   - Directories are no longer collapsed when an item underneath them changes.
   - The selection is managed a lot better as the directories change.
   - Assemblies now default to being drawn in red.
* Improved auto-complete:
   - Fixed two crashes for files with no using directives.
   - The right members are now shown if System.Enum is being completed (as opposed 
   to an enum type).
   - Auto-completing the base keyword will now show protected members.
   - Fixed completion for var variables which use as expressions.
   - Improved auto-complete chaining for methods which return arrays.
   - Events now auto-complete.
   - Double tab now completes "new xxx" where xxx is the stem of an aliased type.
   - Auto-completion inside nested classes wasn't finding locals and arguments.
   - Auto-complete was not finding nested class names.
* Improved show short form:
   - Enums are now special cased so they look a lot nicer.
   - Attributes are now included for types and members.
   - Operators now have their own section.
   - Moved static members to the end.
   - Types which are both asbtract and sealed are now shown as static.
* Improved the Open Selection command:
   - It will now popup a dialog allowing you to select the paths you want to open if there
   are more than two possibilities (instead of opening up to ten and beeping if there are
   more than ten).
   - The text is now trimmed before the command tries to open it.
   - Try to open files before urls (we didn't always get errors when trying to open bogus urls).
   - It now does a better job finding files with the locate command when some of the
   files it returns no longer exist.
* Type names in type declarations now default to being styled with a cool shadow.
* Rewrote the language element styler so that it's more responsive and reliable.
* Renamed "Find on Apple" "Search in Apple".
* Renamed "Find on MSDN" "Search in MSDN".
* Tab stops defaults to 18 instead of 20.
* Changed the window name used with svn blame, cat, diff, and log.
* Edited find results were not being dimmed when the edit happened.
* Dirty files were not always being saved correctly before make was run. This was because
   of undo coalescing in the document.
* The match entire words find option now works much better if the search text does not 
   start or end with a letter
* Made *.svn-blame and *.svn-log plain text.
* Zero length text files were not being opened correctly.
* Fixed a bug which sometimes caused infinite loops if preprocessor directives were
   embedded in verbatim strings.
* Text style button titles weren't always updating when the text attributes changed.
* Open file for types/members now works a bit better when some of the types/members
   have no associated path (e.g. we couldn't find an mdb file for some assemblies).
* Make windows the main window on right clicks so the context commands don't get confused.
* Renamed Add Formatted ToString refactor Implement IFormattable and changed
   it so it adds the IFormattable base if it is not already present.
* Fixed regexen for C and Obejctive-C so #ifdef is styled correctly.
* Type database no longer aborts processing assemblies when the assemblies mdb file doesn't
   match the assembly.
* Updated the default makefile target ignore list.
* Conversion operators are now named using the type instead of "<conversion>" so that
   they now work properly with syntax hiliting.
   
Version 0.4 (r156)

* (Mostly) implemented auto-complete.
* Added support for reading and writing utf16, 7-bit ASCII, rtf, html, word, open xml, and
  open document files.
* Added a Font menu for files which are not syntax hilited. 
* Region directives now appear in the popup as disabled items (if the option key is not down).
* Sccs menu now works for text editor windows (instead of just for directory editor windows).
* Option tab now selects the next identifier using the c# scanner. Option-shift-tab
   does the reverse.
* Open type context menu item now falls back to using the locate command so interfaces 
   and enums can be opened (if their file name is the same as the type name).
* Open type context menu items now disambiguate file names if neccesary.   
* Method names in the context menu now look better (C# aliased type names are used,
   namespaces are removed, and params/this/ref/out keywords are added to parameters).
* Open selection command now treats the mono root as a preferred directory.
* Added a directory pref to add spaces before method args.
* Added a directory pref to put curly braces on their own lines (for refactor commands).
* Added Convert to Hex and Convert to Decimal scripts.
* Added a menu item to install a tool which can be used to open files in continuum (or
  foreshadow).
* Added CoreFoundation to the default find in files directories.
* Improved Transcript window speed.
* Fixed searching locked files.
* Make the editor window the key window on context click (otherwise confusion ensues
   when we try to process the menu command).
* Fixed styler sorting bug which sometimes causes styles to not be applied correctly.
* Sleep a bit after saving files to attempt to ensure that make recognizes that the files have 
  changed.
* Instead of killing the app fallback on stdout if the log file cannot be created.
* Only enable the refactor menu items if a text editor window is the main window and it's
  editing C#.
* Fixed a few minor bugs in the C# parser.
* Short form shows the assembly for the most derived type, not the most base type.
* Cleaned up some problems with using sqlite from threads.
* Object databases are now about 3x smaller.
* Databases are now placed into ~/Library/Caches/Continuum (note that Time Machine
   ignores this directory).
* Moved scripts to ~/Library/Application Support/Continuum.


Version 0.2 (r18)
* First public release.
