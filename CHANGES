Version 0.4 (r156)

* (Mostly) implemented auto-complete.
* Added support for reading and writing utf16, 7-bit ASCII, rtf, html, word, open xml, and
  open document files.
* Added a Font menu for files which are not syntax hilited. 
* Region directives now appear in the popup as disabled items (if the option key is not down).
* Sccs menu now works for text editor windows (instead of just for directory editor windows).
* Option tab now selects the next identifier using the c# scanner. Option-shift-tab
   does the reverse.
* Open type context menu item now falls back to using the locate command so interfaces 
   and enums can be opened (if their file name is the same as the type name).
* Open type context menu items now disambiguate file names if neccesary.   
* Method names in the context menu now look better (C# aliased type names are used,
   namespaces are removed, and params/this/ref/out keywords are added to parameters).
* Open selection command now treats the mono root as a preferred directory.
* Added a directory pref to add spaces before method args.
* Added a directory pref to put curly braces on their own lines (for refactor commands).
* Added Convert to Hex and Convert to Decimal scripts.
* Added a menu item to install a tool which can be used to open files in continuum (or
  foreshadow).
* Added CoreFoundation to the default find in files directories.
* Improved Transcript window speed.
* Fixed searching locked files.
* Make the editor window the key window on context click (otherwise confusion ensues
   when we try to process the menu command).
* Fixed styler sorting bug which sometimes causes styles to not be applied correctly.
* Sleep a bit after saving files to attempt to ensure that make recognizes that the files have 
  changed.
* Instead of killing the app fallback on stdout if the log file cannot be created.
* Only enable the refactor menu items if a text editor window is the main window and it's
  editing C#.
* Fixed a few minor bugs in the C# parser.
* Short form shows the assembly for the most derived type, not the most base type.
* Cleaned up some problems with using sqlite from threads.
* Object databases are now about 3x smaller.
* Databases are now placed into ~/Library/Caches/Continuum (note that Time Machine
   ignores this directory).
* Moved scripts to ~/Library/Application Support/Continuum.


Version 0.2 (r18)
* First public release.
