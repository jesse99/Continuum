* Allow files and asemblies to be disasembled:
	- context menu needs to support type::name
	- add support for viewing resources
		` bin language
		` extensions are stuff like dylib and mdb
	- add get ifno for resources
	- remember window positions
	- add support for disassemble method (and maybe type)
	- if method is in more than one local assembly display a picker
	- start with the assembly built last selected
* Time Machine didn't show an age (just "ago")
* Find doesn't always show the selection
* Autocomplete doesn't seem to work with stuff like fields when the context is a getter.
* Add a resources section to the disassembler.
* Open selection should use a picker if too many candidates.
* Add (all) attributes and security to short form types and methods.
* Fix dir editor so it doesn't collapse child dirs when an item changes.
* After duplicating directory items select the new item(s).
* Make sure spelling and grammar menu works OK.
* Add support for building with nant:
	- make sure Monobj examples can be built
	- might need an extra binaries project pref for builders who drop the binaries in
	  weird places
* Might want to display a picker if the user selects an ellipsis from a context menu.
* Review thread safety
* Enter should add snippets:
	- look at CodeTemplates file
	- $NAME is a placeholder
	- insert NAME (or maybe assk the user for the real name)
	- select the first place holder (if we don't ask users for the name)
	- also need $date and $year
	- first time a snippet is used copy the snippets to a local dir
	- if a local snippet dir exists also copy any new snippets (on startup and on dir changed)
	- snippets: add class, iterface, struct, exception, unit test, method rule, type rule
	- get rid of Create Exception refactor
* Can we do some sort of notification when assemblies finish parsing? Or to show parse
   error message? Maybe a notifications window? Or directory window can have a
   label somewhere? Also NSToolTipAttributeName
   - could say stuff like "parsing mscorlib...", "parsing mscorlib...done", "[parser]
     expected '}' on line 56"
* Build errors should use annotations. What about the "Error 1 of 10" text?
* Might be neat if could figure out languages for files with no extension using
   the shebang (if present).
* Mention option-tab somewhere.
* Should be able to get rid of NSTreatUnknownArgumentsAsOpen hack.
* Open method context menu items should be sorted by full declaring type name
	- so TryParse should show the local stuff and then the system versions
* Look at NSObject leaks again:
	- try the mono profilers again
	- might also want to look at the new performance counters
	- make sure the little objects like strings aren't being leaked
	- may want to add a debug flag to NSObject so it can store stack traces
	- text windows
	- editor windows
	- method completion window
	- argument completion window
* Should spell check comments
	- types and members should count as valid words
* Might want to use NSFindPboard.
* Need to comment out the snk line in cecil's standalone make file.
* Make sure ComputeRuns is not called if runs are up to date.
* Implement interface refactor.
* Add Find in Spotlight.
* Preprocessor commands can screw up the parser, see FileStream.cs for example.
* Work on tab completion:
	- might want to support completing names via F5, should also have a menu item
	   for this	
	- if a name cannot be resolved at all maybe it should be underlined in orange
	- would be really nice to add an auto-complete (and maybe object-model)
	  functional test
	- get pointers completing
	- get arrays completing
	- get indexers completing
	- get bound generics compelting
	- might want to allow attributes to be tab completed
	- it would be nice if tab could be used to complete type names, but the UI may
	  be a bit gnarly if there is an ambiguity
	- can we show the comments for the selection? maybe in a second window? or
	   maybe some sort of context help window that can also be shown if the text 
	   window selection is within a method? or a growl sort of window?
	- need to work with namespace aliases
	- might want to special case "throw new "
* Expose CsBases.HasBaseClass to refactor.
* Don't do brace hiliting if insertion point is not within code.
* Implement IDisposable added throw to a private method.
* Expose CsGlobalNamespace.Malformed to refactor. Or don't refactor if there are
   parse errors.
* Rework Apply:
	- use an AppliedRunsTable
	- table is updated (using a thread) for edits
	- table does a binary search of two tables (normal and type runs)
	- probably want a unit test
	- apply is one pass
	- apply can special case default runs when doing a full apply
	- use a thread to figure out which runs need to be applied
* Could probably speed up editing of large files if we got a pointer to the text from
  native code and operated on that with unsafe code.
* Code that executes in response to an edit should be constant time. If not queue
   up a timer and do it after editing stops.
* Might want to submit a bug report for System.Threading.ThreadPool.
* Also why didn't PulseAll work?
* Can probably add a Lift Code to Method refactor now.
* Don't die if a factory pref handler throws.
* Add some tool tips to the nibs.
* Should not iterate over the entire opened directory.
* Might be nice to bury all the C# knowledge in a plugin.
* Might want a context menu to toggle showing/hiding of parse error annonations.
* Need to handle aliaii in the Continuum directory.
* Probably need to handle aliaii in open panels as well.
* Find button locations look a bit odd.
* mono root finder may not be correct.
* Need a preference for Type.GetFieldName
* Get parse errors for show base class. Maybe use an rtf format instead of cs.
* Handle languages like scripts.
	- TODO could go here
	- should be able to override built in languages
	- what about globs? can globs be overriden?
	- might want a language for gendarme console reports, what extension?
* Add a ChangeLog language?
* Need a directory for custom plugins:
	- google code search might be a good example
* Foreshadow/continuum scripts need work:
	- should work if continuum is not running
	- should be able to start/bring to front without an arg
	- should be able to open dirs
	- handle spaces in args
	- support line numbers via colons
* About box needs a bit more info.
* Use the 2.2 cecil?
* Move Continuum directory to prefs or maybe app support? Has really big files
   though so its not clear we should hide it like this.
* Need some way to install the continuum script.
* Probably want an uninstall script.
* May want to bundle cecil with the app.
* Confirmation if opening a big file.
* Confirmation if the user really wants to open a bunch of files
	- open files
	- return in dir editor
	- return in find in files result
* Do a release.
   
* Add support for auto backing up files. keepBackupFile
* Should be able to style txt files (or maybe just rtf file).
* Need to do something with the spelling and grammar menu.
* Support optional word wrap.
* Window, scroller position, word wrap should be saved in a (project) database.
* Work on intellisense.
* Allow utf-16 to be read.
* Allow files to be saved with different line endings.
* Need a menu (like TextEdit) to specify encoding on load.
* Would also be nice if directory editor context menu had support for opening as 
  different encodings or file types.
* Warn on mixed line endings read.
* Need to set file type for saved files.
* Should be able to open locked files.
* Should be able to run from read-only media.
* Database file names should probably include a hash or something for the dir path.
* Might want to expose CsPreprocess to refactor.
* Add ChangeLog support.
* Add better support for svn commits.
* Add text get info:
	- selection offset
	- selection length
	- bytes
	- number of lines
	- full path
* Add file get info:
	- work with multiple selection
	- do something reasonable with both files and directories
	- print bytes
	- print directory valence
	- print flags
* Open selection should use some sort of picker.
* Look at startup times.
* Add support for nant.
* Add support for scons.
* Might want to allow enter to complete types and statements:
	- should be template files
	- users can edit these to put braces where they want
	- users can add new templates (e.g. to paste copyright clause)
* Work on extract method refactor. Should be able to handle this with the locals
   parser and the scanner.
* Work on rename refactor:
	- if not private then do a make all
	- use all of the local assemblies
	- if the name cannot be found in an assembly emit an error (eg type isn't part of the
	   build yet)
	- only change local files
* Need a way to build weird projects like Cecil, probably a pref with a build
  command line which overrides make builder.
* Add an assembly viewer
* Show IL (for member/type) command.
* Look at iron python scripting (might also be able to use this for the refactor language)
* Add a hex viewer. Should work with big files. Maybe memory map them.
* Command-8, or 2, or -, should switch between frontmost and next frontmost text windows.
	- enable if there are more than two text windows and the main window is a text window
	- probably need to track window z-order ourself
	- might want a cycle command as well
* Work on parser:
	- see what safe speed is
	- what about #if false?
	- should we try to handle #if some_thing?
	- remove unsafe from test.dll, plugin dll, and the class
	- might want to use a StringSlice class in the scanner and parser, maybe with an
	  implicit or explicit conversion to string
	- think about integrating refactors into builds, might allow for AOP sort of stuff
* Should be able to find properties like BuildStartTime.
* Can we always generate response files? Maybe fix the timestamp?
* Would be nice to have a find on python site command.
* Short form should show comments
	- both types
	- should be able to do this w/o the scanner
	- will need to special case attributes
	- would be nice if we can tell if file does not match mdb
* Add support for refactoring:
	dump fields (may require reflection)
	dump args, locals, fields used in a method
	rename arg, need some sort of minimal statement/expr parser
	rename field, need table with fields used by each type
	rename method
	rename type
	split (non-cohesive) class
	trace methods, might want to ask if exit should be traced
* Is cancel really killing the process?
* May want to use the thread pool for any short lived threads.
* Add (query) unicode database.
* Add a simple calculator. Could use python or cssharp to evaluate expressions
  and print them in one or more bases.
  - or maybe an mpw style csharp shell
  - context menu could allow output format(s) to be set
* Libraries (but not apps) should always be built as debug?
	- need to check to see if anything would be slow
* Pref file has an awful lot of -origin-x entries.
* Would be nice to have a monkey. Would probably need to disable save and things
   like move to trash or svn revert.
* Work on features to make debugging and maintainability easier:
	- find references
	- method popup
	- queries?
* Editor should work as well as bbedit:
	- method widget
	- languages xml might need an option for word wrap
	- use setAutosaveExpandedItems?
	- might want a favorites menu
* Would be cool to support saving styles as rtf and html.
* Should support rectangular selections (option-shift-drag).
* Support bookmarks:
	- make sure we can embed graphics in the text, or use a floating window?
	- add bookmark (cmd-/) adds up to nine bookmarks
	- once at nine replaces ninth bookmark
	- little graphic of a digit indicates bookmark
	- cmd-1 to 9 change the selection to the bookmark
	- bookmark is found with a live line number
	- cmd-0 clears bookmarks
* Work on databases:
	- add a comment about separate versus mondo database
	- can we add some sort of prefer local attribute for use when too many fields are
	  returned?
	- what if someone opens a root dir? maybe we should parse only immediate child
	  directories? would probably need an option to recurse deeper
	- probably should default to deleting the db on exit
	- try using an assembly id instead of the hash for the key
	- get the db size and the time for the second use of context menu
* Seem to be problems with leaks:
	- most NSConcreteTextStorage are going away but not all of them
	- NSConcreteTextStorage retain counts look OK so maybe cocoa is caching them
	- someone has a reference, maybe Styler
	- might want to register Styler and some other objects with a WeakList to see
	  if they are going away
* Might want to use alert sheets:
	http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/Sheets/Tasks/UsingAlertSheets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001045
* Might want to add an align columns script. Kind of tricky to do though if the font
   is proportional and tabs use stops.
* Get find references working.
* Might want goto begin end of declaration commands.
* Would be nice to degrade gracefully if sqlite is not installed (or has the wrong
   version)
* Get code completion working:
	- use dir editor windows as project roots
	- note that we don't need a full blown parser: can get by with a top-level
	  class parser and a scanner for locals (var types will probably need a 
	  simple expr scanne). Or blow off parsing and just use cecil.
	- note that NSTextView already has some support for text completion
* Undo has some problems with saving:
	http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2002/12/28/62337
* Need a way to easily open recent dirs.
* More stuff:
	code collapsing
	integrated svn
	queries
	scid
	time machine
	alternate key bindings
	integrated gendarme
	diff
	more complex refactors
	replay
	code coverage
	gross performance cues
* Good manifesto:
	http://alarmingdevelopment.org/index.php?p=5
	schematic tables
* Add widgets:
	- fun popup
	- fun should have classes and methods
	- option click should sort
	- popup value should change as insertion pt moves
* Can we up the limit on the number of files in the open recent menu, Supposed to
  be able to use maximumRecentDocumentCount, but when I tried it was not called.
* Do we want to use the entity approach? What does that mean for dir editor?
* Do some more work on the svn plugin:
	- ignore list, could probably use propget and propset
	- add an svn manage command to do stuff like diffs and updates for the whole tree
	- would be nice to better support revision numbers, maybe with a popup menu
* Can we prevent the text view from treating colons as word characters? Messes
   up option-arrow for example. Afaict there is no good way to do this.
* Would be nice to auto-add using declarations.
* Would be nice to collapse copyright boilerplate.
* Would be really cool to have internal and external layout (ie to save files
  using mono's crappy layout)
* Keep an XML view of the open source documents in sync with the source
	- need some sort of BadParse element, really we need a scanner more than a
	  parser
	- need a visual cue for bad parse lines
	- xml is just a view, can't edit it
* Would be nice to have color schemes. Should be easy to edit these.
* Need a way to view what's happening to the code:
	- save an annotated copy of open source files
	- canonical copy should also be saved
	- if crash need to pop up an alert and restore canonical copy
	- edits should goto both files
	- to start with annotated copy can record lines executed
	- sidebar or something can show lines executed for last run
	- later could add a debugger sort of thing for open files
* Replay feature:
	- instrument all assemblies
	- on method entry record method and thread ids
	- for stepping could instrument branches and record taken/not taken, when
	  debugging create a reversible data structure
	- should have an attribute to disable stepping in time critical code
	- exception handlers need special instrumentation
	- on field store record new value, maybe just ToString with a few special cases
	  or inject ToReplayString if no ToString override and to default ToReplayString
	- interop stores will be a little tricky, may have to special case blittable
	  types
	- should be able to set breakpoints, go forward, backward, etc
	  conditional breakpoints
	- break on exception
	- could show code easily
	- instead of showing a stack crawl show a stack crawl region
	- won't instrumenting assemblies break pdb files?
	- could show field history
	- ref and out types would need special handling
	- how do we figure out which fields refer to which objects?
* mono has a code coverage switch.
* Work on background builds:
	- could so this on save
	- maybe write a message when starting
	- cancel if user saves again or starts a real build
	- not sure how to handle errors, could write an error message saying "There
	  were 12 errors from the background build." and let users do a next error
	- recursive makes are hard to cancel
* Might want to use row types.
* Support DBC via a python script
	- google for dbc and c#
	- google for c# parser/grammar
	- if an assert fails exception should include assert expr and names/values for the
	  variables
	- post should support old(argName)
	- inject calls to Invariant if one is present, optionally disable via an attibute
	  or comment
* Work on object-model plugin:
	- windows showing query results should probably be live
	- when doing a lookup need to only return the assemblies used by the file being
	  edited
	- need to handle namespaces better
		` first try to treat x.y.z as a fully qualified name
		` then check only the imported namespaces
		` also handle aliased namespaces
	- support interface locate (probably requires a custom database populator using
	  a parser, also a source or provider column in the tables)
	- support locate for other weird types like enums and delegates
* Comments should be wiki format.
* Would be cool to have a generate docs option. As html and some form suitable
  for printing (maybe pdf).
* First time a file is opened show a skeleton of public (and maybe protected)
  members with no method bodies (except maybe asserts).
* Can we do some sort of subtle hiliting of variable uses if the selection is
  in a variable name?
* Allow most everything to be collapsable?
* Maybe have some visual cue for gross performance.
* Can we link methods and tests somwhow?
* Do we want to make the app scriptable and recordable?
* Might be nice to have a structured c# editor. Would allow nice stuff like 
  user specific formating, local variable tab completion, smart statement 
  insertion/tabbing, xml comment hiding/formatting, faster context menus, etc. 
  One issue is that it would kind of suck to change an entire file to use 
  project formatting if only one line changed.
* Very important to be able to grok the code:
	- static structure
	- dynamic behavior
		` app wide (code flow, threads, memory, assemblies)
		` inter-procedural (threads, who called this)
		` local (debugger, logging)
* Should be able to easily form simple custom relations, eg
  nant target <--> log file
* Need to store revisions for custom relation objects.
* Might want selected smokey rules always on (eg bad casts)
* Lot's of good scid examples here:
	http://mindprod.com/project/scid.html
* Also
	http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/06/whidbey_may_mis.html
* Have to be careful of language lockin.
* Might be able to do some refactors with drag and drop.
* Look into lisp and smalltalk ides. Squeak and etoys.
* Review intentional programming.
* Look at other editors, eg TextMate.
* Should be able to diff two entity instances.
* Experiment with a runtime monitor plugin:
	- have a low priority thread which monitors memory usage
	- maybe use attributes or something to monitor runtime of selected methods
	- maybe method/code coverage
	- store results in a database somewhere?
	- pop an alert if differences between two runs exceed some threshold
* Look at literate programming again. TextMate, BBEdit, SlickEdit, MSVS, Eclipse,
  Apple's. Resharper is supposed to be sweet.
* IntelliJ IDEA is supposed to be one of the best IDEs
	if I want to go to class MyMouseEventListener it's "Ctrl-NMMEL")
* http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
* Review other editors.
* http://code.google.com/p/opentf/
* Links: user editable list of text files, pdf files, html links, etc
* Work on a structure editor?
	- statements and method arguments should be plain text?
	- might want empty blocks: correspond to non-terminals and act as insertion pts
	- http://www.osenkov.com/diplom/
	- http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/is1/articles/04/10/lop/4.html
	- add an xml editor first?
	- might want sibling (cmd-[]), child (cmd-/), and peer (cmd-\) nodes
	  child would be xml text or child element, peer would be attribute
	- should be a generic framework (but only support c# for now)
	- need structure definitions, eg if is a statement with an
	  expression and a body, probably needs presentation info too (make this
	  separate?)
	- don't load malformed files
	- when saving incomplete files use a special comment so we can load properly
	- comments will be a bit tricky, probably need a hueristic to attach them to a node
	- display should be non-editable text view
	- return should open up an expandable text field for that node
	- can delete contents and hit return to change node types
	- use a gradient to color a node and its children
	- optionally omit ;, noisy (), {}
	- need both a view and a save style
	- would be nice if save saved only the code that changed (or maybe the method(s)
	  that were edited)
	- would be cool if invariant support could be added via a script		
* Release checklist:
	- update generated config file logging categories
	- update the version number
	- delete build_num
	- make sure text editor boss goes away (after forcing a GC)
	- make sure text objects go away
	- make sure auto complete objects go away
	- make sure directory editor boss goes away
	- make sure directory objects go away
	- run continuum with no prefs
	- run continuum with no databases (including the windows db)
	- run continuum with no Continuum Files dir
	- review generated config log categories
	- look at memory usage
	- run unit tests in debug
	- run unit tests in release
	- make sure untitled docs work OK
	- review config file
	- run from the finder
	- review tar targets
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- upload the new binary
	- build a new foreshadow
