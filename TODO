need user manual
help menu should have Open Manual
find file/type/method could use text similarity algorithm

* Use the debugging attributes:
	- may want to add debugger attributes to some common cocoa classes
		` maybe proxies for cocoa collections
		` maybe gear classes too
* May want to look at the MonoDevelop change logs.
* May want a warning if mac os roman is used to open a file.
* Make sure assembly databases purge assemblies:
	- maybe every 30 mins could purge assemblies that no longer exist
	- might want to also purge assemblies that have not been used in a long time
* Probably want some sort of advanced prefs panel:
	- these should be for stuff that most people won't want to change
	- find wraps
	- reverse paths in find all
	- reverse paths in document window titles
* Add better support for AppleScript/IronPython (and concurrently use it to write functional tests).
	http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/applescriptforapps.html
	http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptableCocoaApplications/SApps_about_apps/SAppsAboutApps.html
	http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2002/tn2106.html
	man 5 sdef
	tell application "Continuum" to save document 1 in "/tmp/foo.html" as "HTML"
	- introspection
	- can scripts add new implemenations? or replace old ones?
* Can use IronPython for scripting:
	http://blogs.msdn.com/srivatsn/archive/2008/09/16/hosting-ironpython-made-easier.aspx
	http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/Hosting_IronPython_2
* Can we add an immediate (MPW style) window which uses Iron Python?
* Work on highlighting:
	- use a better format than xml? or just use source-highlight?
	- can we support custom elements? maybe hard-code colors? or on startup build a list of installed elements
	- would be nice to support more elements, e.g. file:///Users/jessejones/Downloads/source-highlight-3.1.4/doc/source-highlight.html#Output-format-style
	- maybe source-highlight's syntax or one modeled after it
	- can we convert the source-highlight lang files into our files?
* Need a directory for custom plugins:
	- debugger visualizer might be a good example
	- google code search might be a good example
	- or maybe a simple diff tool	regime
	- or maybe a MRU window list (context menu?)
* Add support for custom plugins:
	- would it be possible for custom plugins to define IB menus which are merged into the real menus?
	- would be nice to have some sort of extras directory
	- could have a demo plugin that customizes menus, like 2010-10-manipulate-menus.diff
	- maybe also support for overriding standard plugins
* Some sort of dynamic find files thingy.
* Can we improve syntax hilghting? Maybe with something other than regexen? Would be
   nice to optionally style types, fields, methods, locals and arguments.
   - also different colors for classes vs structs, static access vs instance access, etc
* File a ticket (and investigate further) stepping over p/invokes.
* Auto-complete speed is kind of poor:

	- database is only about 0.013
	- so the bulk of the time seems to be logic and such
	- maybe it would help if we restricted searches by leveraging the using declarations in the file
* Look at the new error bubbles in snow leopard's XCode.	
* Look at using a replacement for sqlite. Maybe a custom database or some nosql sort of thing.
* Are old assemblies being left behind in the database?
* Use the new StackFrame.GetVisibleVariables method?
* Shouldn't we warn if two language files use the same language?
* Should deduce type of typeof(xxx).
* Would be nice not to highlight the linq query keywords (from, which, etc) if System.Linq is not
   being used.
* Doesn't the create thread refactor need to use a field for the thread object?
* Mention useful to download mono source (and set the associated pref):
	- dont need to compile
	- allows source level debugging, context menus allow you to go to definitions for mono methods
* Add a show command:
	- should be a context menu for selected types
	- not live, but when resuming disable the text
	- support ints, char, string, IntPtr, UIntPtr
	- should be live, how do we do this? struct mirrors at least need to be re-generated, maybe
	  store a path to the field being watched?
* Confirmation if the user really wants to open a bunch of files
	- open files
	- return in dir editor
	- return in find in files result
* Do a new release.

* Outlining.
* Get rid of glob files? Would be easier (and less confusing) if the default globs were part of the language.
* Work on a debugger:
	- context breakpoint menu should have close do a broadcast so the breakpoint can be toggled
* Should DoGetOperatorName handle names like:
	ObjectModel Error bad operator: op_UnaryNegation_Int32
	maybe tweak the warning?
* Genie effect with auto-complete is distracting?
* Period should work like return in auto-complete window.
* Should make font bigger (or smaller) change the defaults for source code windows? It would probably
   have to change all the defaults?
* Do some more work on the debugger:
	- would be nice if could add breakpoints to IL views
	- add an immediate window
	- allow richer expressions in conditional breakpoints
	- might be cool to keep a fixed window of variable histories
	- allow users to set the ToString format specifier?
	- can't set values for types like IntPtr, Nullable`1
	- support remote debugging
	- breakpoint conditions should be persisted
	- would be nice if conditional expressions worked with types, eg int.MaxValue
	- allow more complex expressions (and properties) to be used with conditional breakpoints
	- might want to, at least optionally, show properties in the variables window
	- watchpoint windows
		` drag and drop to add new variables
		` draw in gray if the current context does not have the variable in any stack frame
	- moving the instruction pointer
	- custom viewer dlls
* Why doesn't stuff like var thread = (ThreadMirror) value auto-complete?
* Show short form on Action didn't show the Delegate members.
* Dot should complete auto-complete text.
* Auto-complete window should have context menu for showing only properties.
* Maybe optionally hide fields too.
* Add a pref to make find wrap around?
* Couldn't open (via drag and drop) /Users/jessejones/Source/Third_Party/mono-2.6.3/mono/mini/ChangeLog
* Mention can right click on completion window.
* Attributes and base classes need to handle global::
* global should be a c# keyword?
* Does setting the text color still work in prefs?
* Option-arrow is skipping over periods.
* Would be nice to support hyperlinks in rich text files
	http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2006/qa1487.html
* NSWorkspace has new methods to duplicate and trash files.
* NSError has a helpAnchor method.
* Generate stub seems fairly nifty.
* Work on collection support:
	- classes that implement ICollection should use EnumerableValue
	- may want to also support arbitrary IEnumerable types
	- may want a context menu to show more than the first 200 items
* Stagger windows, especially find results and assembly browser.
* Need to do a better job with Refactor Language.rtf (prose and the grammar)
* http://cx4a.org/software/gccsense/
* Read up on MEF
	http://www.codeplex.com/MEF
* Refactor to generate forwarding methods? Maybe can select methods and then it generates
   forwarding methods which can be cut and pasted. Or select a field and it pops up a dialog
   allowing user to pick which methods he wants to forward.
* Allow auto-completion via "CamelHumps"?
	- ie for "WriteLine" can type "WL"
* Add a ToString refactror, should default to returning fields and auto-props
* Do the same for implement IFormatable.
* MonoDevelop has an interesting Dynamic Abbrev Command: http://monodevelop.com/Download/What%27s_new_in_MonoDevelop_2.2
* Get refactors enabling and disabling.
* Add refactors to context menu.
* Might be able to do some new refactors now like rename and extract method.
* Do something different with /// styling?
* Think about ways to allow easier customization and looser coupling. Maybe can use tuple spaces
   to communicate (and even to do UI). How would we handle notifications? Or maybe a Plan 9
   style virtual file system using unix sockets (concurrency may be an issue)
* Make Add WriteLine a standard refactor?
* Add Find Type command:
	- uses a regex
	- searches all types referenced by the current assembly
	- start with System.*
* Implement/Override Members
	- pops up a dialog showing all the methods that can be overriden/implemented
	- can check the ones to add
	- stubbed methods are added
	- might also want custom context menu when right clicking on "override"
* Rename type refactor
* Rename member refactor.
* File compare.
* Directory compare.
* Extract method refactor.
* Extract class refactor.
* Safe delete refactor.
* Remove Unused Using declarations:
	- this should remove declarations that are definitely not needed
	- error if file is newer than assembly
	- process assembly and find the namespaces which were used
	- remove any which were listed but not actually used
* Change signature refactor.
* Complete Statement would be nice:
	- adds parens, braces, semi-colons, etc
* Optimize using directives
* Add Find Uses/References
	- needs to be smarter than a text search
	- add a warning icon or label if the current assembly is not up to date
	- file must be up to date if the member we're searching for is overloaded?
* "Resolve" context menu command - you can use it to insert a missing
   "using" statement without going to the top of the document.
* Implement help.
* Add a refactor to add xml comment placeholders?
* Odd things can happen when case differs in file paths. Should things like WindowDatabase
   normalize path casing? An example is a make file which uses a line like Source/*.cs where
   the case of Source does not match the file system. If there are errors in a source file then
   the window jumps around a bit and double clicking the error window doesn't work.
   - what if the file system is case sensitive?
* Might want to log memory and NSObject highwater marks.
* Short form should have doc comments:
	- arg completion window should have param and typeparam comments
	- style these
	- maybe use an html view, could have links to/from summary form and remarks
* Auto-complete table should have comments too.
* Double tab should also complete english words:
	- use completionsForPartialWordRange:inString:language:inSpellDocumentWithTag:
	- probably want to add some sort of double tab framework
 Add a general svn command. Something like:
	- floating window
	- left side has a directory view showing directory items and revision numbers
	- need to watch the root
	- context menu should open the window and show the selected item
	- top has popdowns with command, revision 1 (defaults to head), and revision 2
	  (defaults to nothing)
	- middle has editable text field with the command to be executed
	- bottom has help and execute buttons
	- output goes to either transcript or a new window
	- probably need a way to set the more uncommon options
* Enter should add snippets:
	- look at CodeTemplates file
	- $NAME is a placeholder
	- insert NAME (or maybe assk the user for the real name)
	- select the first place holder (if we don't ask users for the name)
	- also need $date and $year
	- first time a snippet is used copy the snippets to a local dir
	- if a local snippet dir exists also copy any new snippets (on startup and on dir changed)
	- snippets: add class, iterface, struct, exception, unit test, method rule, type rule
	- get rid of Create Exception refactor
* Can we do some sort of notification when assemblies finish parsing? Or to show parse
   error message? Maybe a notifications window? Or directory window can have a
   label somewhere? Also NSToolTipAttributeName
   - could say stuff like "parsing mscorlib...", "parsing mscorlib...done", "[parser]
     expected '}' on line 56"
* Build errors should use annotations. What about the "Error 1 of 10" text?
* Would be neat to have mcocoa project templates:
	- generate source files, nibs, info.plist
	- also either make or nant
	- also a TODO file listing what needs to be customized
* Should be able to get rid of NSTreatUnknownArgumentsAsOpen hack.
* Open method context menu items should be sorted by full declaring type name
	- so TryParse should show the local stuff and then the system versions
* Should spell check comments
	- types and members should count as valid words
* Might want to use NSFindPboard.
* Make sure ComputeRuns is not called if runs are up to date.
* Implement interface refactor.
* Preprocessor commands can screw up the parser, see FileStream.cs for example.
* Work on tab completion:
	- might want to support completing names via F5, should also have a menu item
	   for this	
	- if a name cannot be resolved at all maybe it should be underlined in orange
	- would be really nice to add an auto-complete (and maybe object-model)
	  functional test
	- get pointers completing
	- get arrays completing
	- get indexers completing
	- get bound generics compelting
	- might want to allow attributes to be tab completed
	- it would be nice if tab could be used to complete type names, but the UI may
	  be a bit gnarly if there is an ambiguity
	- can we show the comments for the selection? maybe in a second window? or
	   maybe some sort of context help window that can also be shown if the text 
	   window selection is within a method? or a growl sort of window?
	- need to work with namespace aliases
	- might want to special case "throw new "
* Expose CsBases.HasBaseClass to refactor.
* Don't do brace hiliting if insertion point is not within code.
* Implement IDisposable added throw to a private method.
* Expose CsGlobalNamespace.Malformed to refactor. Or don't refactor if there are
   parse errors.
* Could probably speed up editing of large files if we got a pointer to the text from
  native code and operated on that with unsafe code.
* Code that executes in response to an edit should be constant time. If not queue
   up a timer and do it after editing stops.
* Don't die if a factory pref handler throws.
* Add some tool tips to the nibs.
* Might be nice to bury all the C# knowledge in a plugin.
* Might want a context menu to toggle showing/hiding of parse error annonations.
* Need to handle aliaii in the Continuum directory.
* Probably need to handle aliaii in open panels as well.
* Need a preference for Type.GetFieldName
* Get parse errors for show base class. Maybe use an rtf format instead of cs.
* Add a ChangeLog language?
* Foreshadow/continuum scripts need work:
	- should work if continuum is not running
	- should be able to start/bring to front without an arg
	- handle spaces in args
	- support line numbers via colons
	- finder seems to sometimes get confused about which mono app to open
	- could use a custom apple event (or maybe add parameters to the open event)
* About box needs a bit more info.
* Probably want an uninstall script.
* Need to set file type for saved files.
* Should be able to run from read-only media.
* Database file names should probably include a hash or something for the dir path.
* Might want to expose CsPreprocess to refactor.
* Add ChangeLog support.
* Add support for scons.
* Might want to allow enter to complete types and statements:
	- should be template files
	- users can edit these to put braces where they want
	- users can add new templates (e.g. to paste copyright clause)
* Work on rename refactor:
	- if not private then do a make all
	- use all of the local assemblies
	- if the name cannot be found in an assembly emit an error (eg type isn't part of the
	   build yet)
	- only change local files
* Need a way to build weird projects like Cecil, probably a pref with a build
  command line which overrides make builder.
* Open as Binary won't work so well with really large files. Can we memory map them somehow?
   Would probably require using a table instead of text view.
* Work on parser:
	- see what safe speed is
	- what about #if false?
	- should we try to handle #if some_thing?
	- remove unsafe from test.dll, plugin dll, and the class
	- might want to use a StringSlice class in the scanner and parser, maybe with an
	  implicit or explicit conversion to string
	- think about integrating refactors into builds, might allow for AOP sort of stuff
* Should be able to find properties like BuildStartTime.
* Can we always generate response files? Maybe fix the timestamp?
* Short form should show comments
	- both types
	- should be able to do this w/o the scanner
	- will need to special case attributes
	- would be nice if we can tell if file does not match mdb
* Add support for refactoring:
	dump fields (may require reflection)
	dump args, locals, fields used in a method
	rename arg, need some sort of minimal statement/expr parser
	rename field, need table with fields used by each type
	rename method
	rename type
	split (non-cohesive) class
	trace methods, might want to ask if exit should be traced
* Cancel seems to have issues with make files (especially recursive ones)
* Add (query) unicode database.
* Add a simple calculator. Could use python or cssharp to evaluate expressions
  and print them in one or more bases.
  - or maybe an mpw style csharp shell
  - context menu could allow output format(s) to be set
* Libraries (but not apps) should always be built as debug?
	- need to check to see if anything would be slow
* Would be nice to have a monkey. Would probably need to disable save and things
   like move to trash or svn revert.
* Editor should work as well as bbedit:
	- use setAutosaveExpandedItems?
	- might want a favorites menu
* Support bookmarks:
	- make sure we can embed graphics in the text, or use a floating window?
	- add bookmark (cmd-/) adds up to nine bookmarks
	- once at nine replaces ninth bookmark
	- little graphic of a digit indicates bookmark
	- cmd-1 to 9 change the selection to the bookmark
	- bookmark is found with a live line number
	- cmd-0 clears bookmarks
* Work on databases:
	- add a comment about separate versus mondo database
	- can we add some sort of prefer local attribute for use when too many fields are
	  returned?
	- what if someone opens a root dir? maybe we should parse only immediate child
	  directories? would probably need an option to recurse deeper
	- probably should default to deleting the db on exit
	- try using an assembly id instead of the hash for the key
	- get the db size and the time for the second use of context menu
* Might want to use alert sheets:
	http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/Sheets/Tasks/UsingAlertSheets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001045
* Might want to add an align columns script. Kind of tricky to do though if the font
   is proportional and tabs use stops.
* Might want goto begin end of declaration commands.
* Would be nice to degrade gracefully if sqlite is not installed (or has the wrong
   version)
* Undo has some problems with saving:
	http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2002/12/28/62337
* Need a way to easily open recent dirs.
* More stuff:
	code collapsing
	queries
	scid
	alternate key bindings
	integrated gendarme
	diff
	more complex refactors
	replay
	code coverage
	gross performance cues
* Good manifesto:
	http://alarmingdevelopment.org/index.php?p=5
	schematic tables
* Do some more work on the svn plugin:
	- ignore list, could probably use propget and propset
	- add an svn manage command to do stuff like diffs and updates for the whole tree
	- would be nice to better support revision numbers, maybe with a popup menu
* Can we prevent the text view from treating colons as word characters? Messes
   up option-arrow for example. Afaict there is no good way to do this.
* Would be nice to auto-add using declarations.
* Would be nice to collapse copyright boilerplate.
* Would be really cool to have internal and external layout (ie to save files
  using mono's crappy layout)
* Keep an XML view of the open source documents in sync with the source
	- need some sort of BadParse element, really we need a scanner more than a
	  parser
	- need a visual cue for bad parse lines
	- xml is just a view, can't edit it
* Would be nice to have color schemes. Should be easy to edit these.
* Need a way to view what's happening to the code:
	- save an annotated copy of open source files
	- canonical copy should also be saved
	- if crash need to pop up an alert and restore canonical copy
	- edits should goto both files
	- to start with annotated copy can record lines executed
	- sidebar or something can show lines executed for last run
	- later could add a debugger sort of thing for open files
* Replay feature:
	- instrument all assemblies
	- on method entry record method and thread ids
	- for stepping could instrument branches and record taken/not taken, when
	  debugging create a reversible data structure
	- should have an attribute to disable stepping in time critical code
	- exception handlers need special instrumentation
	- on field store record new value, maybe just ToString with a few special cases
	  or inject ToReplayString if no ToString override and to default ToReplayString
	- interop stores will be a little tricky, may have to special case blittable
	  types
	- should be able to set breakpoints, go forward, backward, etc
	  conditional breakpoints
	- break on exception
	- could show code easily
	- instead of showing a stack crawl show a stack crawl region
	- won't instrumenting assemblies break pdb files?
	- could show field history
	- ref and out types would need special handling
	- how do we figure out which fields refer to which objects?
* mono has a code coverage switch.
* Work on background builds:
	- could so this on save
	- maybe write a message when starting
	- cancel if user saves again or starts a real build
	- not sure how to handle errors, could write an error message saying "There
	  were 12 errors from the background build." and let users do a next error
	- recursive makes are hard to cancel
* Might want to use row types.
* Work on object-model plugin:
	- windows showing query results should probably be live
	- when doing a lookup need to only return the assemblies used by the file being
	  edited
	- need to handle namespaces better
		` first try to treat x.y.z as a fully qualified name
		` then check only the imported namespaces
		` also handle aliased namespaces
	- support interface locate (probably requires a custom database populator using
	  a parser, also a source or provider column in the tables)
	- support locate for other weird types like enums and delegates
* Comments should be wiki format.
* Would be cool to have a generate docs option. As html and some form suitable
  for printing (maybe pdf).
* First time a file is opened show a skeleton of public (and maybe protected)
  members with no method bodies (except maybe asserts).
* Can we do some sort of subtle hiliting of variable uses if the selection is
  in a variable name?
* Allow most everything to be collapsable?
* Maybe have some visual cue for gross performance.
* Can we link methods and tests somehow?
* Do we want to make the app scriptable and recordable?
* Might be nice to have a structured c# editor. Would allow nice stuff like 
  user specific formating, local variable tab completion, smart statement 
  insertion/tabbing, xml comment hiding/formatting, faster context menus, etc. 
  One issue is that it would kind of suck to change an entire file to use 
  project formatting if only one line changed.
* Very important to be able to grok the code:
	- static structure
	- dynamic behavior
		` app wide (code flow, threads, memory, assemblies)
		` inter-procedural (threads, who called this)
		` local (debugger, logging)
* Lot's of good scid examples here:
	http://mindprod.com/project/scid.html
* Also
	http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/06/whidbey_may_mis.html
* Might be able to do some refactors with drag and drop.
* Look into lisp and smalltalk ides. Squeak and etoys.
* Should be able to diff two entity instances.
* Experiment with a runtime monitor plugin:
	- have a low priority thread which monitors memory usage
	- maybe use attributes or something to monitor runtime of selected methods
	- maybe method/code coverage
	- store results in a database somewhere?
	- pop an alert if differences between two runs exceed some threshold
* Look at literate programming again. TextMate, BBEdit, SlickEdit, MSVS, Eclipse,
  Apple's. Resharper is supposed to be sweet.
* IntelliJ IDEA is supposed to be one of the best IDEs
	if I want to go to class MyMouseEventListener it's "Ctrl-NMMEL")
* http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
* Review other editors.
* http://code.google.com/p/opentf/
* Links: user editable list of text files, pdf files, html links, etc
* Work on a structure editor?
	- statements and method arguments should be plain text?
	- might want empty blocks: correspond to non-terminals and act as insertion pts
	- http://www.osenkov.com/diplom/
	- http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/is1/articles/04/10/lop/4.html
	- add an xml editor first?
	- might want sibling (cmd-[]), child (cmd-/), and peer (cmd-\) nodes
	  child would be xml text or child element, peer would be attribute
	- should be a generic framework (but only support c# for now)
	- need structure definitions, eg if is a statement with an
	  expression and a body, probably needs presentation info too (make this
	  separate?)
	- don't load malformed files
	- when saving incomplete files use a special comment so we can load properly
	- comments will be a bit tricky, probably need a hueristic to attach them to a node
	- display should be non-editable text view
	- return should open up an expandable text field for that node
	- can delete contents and hit return to change node types
	- use a gradient to color a node and its children
	- optionally omit ;, noisy (), {}
	- need both a view and a save style
	- would be nice if save saved only the code that changed (or maybe the method(s)
	  that were edited)
	- would be cool if invariant support could be added via a script		
* Release checklist:
	- update generated config file logging categories (search for "Log.WriteLine")
	- delete build_num
	- make sure directory objects go away
	- make sure directory editor boss goes away
	- make sure text objects go away (after forcing a GC)
	- make sure text editor boss goes away
	- make sure auto complete objects go away
	- make sure debugger bosses go away (CodeViewer boss is hanging around but only once instance)
	- make sure debugger objects go away
	- run continuum with no prefs
	- run continuum with no databases (including the windows db)
	- run continuum with no Continuum Files dir
	- look at memory usage
	- run unit tests in debug
	- run unit tests in release
	- run gendarme
	- search for TODO (in all files)
	- make sure untitled docs work OK
	- build a new foreshadow
	- review BUILDING doc
	- update known issues in the README
	- review README
	- review config file
	- mention that thr debugger requires mono 2.6.3 or later
	- run from the finder
	- review tar targets
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- make sure gear is checked in
	- upload the new binary
	- build a new foreshadow
	- review the front page of the web site
	- review the screen shots
	- email
	- merge release branch into master
	- update version (both in the make file and the readme)
	- get a plan for the next version
