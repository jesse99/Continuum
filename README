Continuum is a light-weight integrated development environment (IDE) targeted at
Mono and C# development. However it can be used to build non-Mono projects and
will work with languages other than C# (although usually not quite as well).

Unlike most IDEs Continuum does not have anything like a solution or project file.
Instead you open directories in Continuum and it looks for Makefile or (eventually)
Nant files which it uses to build. If it is able to find one of these files the directory
window will have a pull-down menu listing the available targets and a build button.
When a directory is first opened all of the assemblies within it (and those they reference)
will be processed in a thread which may bog down the UI a bit until it is finished.

For the most part the interface should be obvious. One exception is that context
menus are available for items in directory and text windows. The directory context
menus will change depending on whether or not the item is part of an svn repository
and whether or not it has been modified. The text context menus will also change
depending on svn and on whether there is a selection and if the selection is a type
or method name.

Also you can define new scripts to operate on selections within text windows using
shell, or python, or ruby or whatever. There's a script README with more info that
you can find using the Open Scripts item in the Text menu.

And you can define new refactors for C# using a custom little language (or a new
plugin). There's a README for script refactors which you can find using the 
Open Refactors item in the Refactor menu.

Note that the type and method databases generated by Continuum can get quite
large because they transitively include all assemblies referenced by assemblies in
the directory you have open. These databases are currently saved in "~/Continuum Files".
